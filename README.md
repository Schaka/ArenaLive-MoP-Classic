# ArenaLive-MoP-Classic

WoD version of ArenaLive (6.2.x patch) for both Unitframes and Spectator combined into standalone AddOn.
This was first ported to patch 5.4.8 and now 5.5.0.

The port is still pretty rudimentary, especially nameplates have had limited testing. 
There are probably a lot of spells that could do with being added.

Screenshot taken in 5.4.8 client. Nameplate scale can be changed in Lua file only so far.
This should receive updates as I keep playing and notice more bugs.
